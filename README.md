Reddit-Underground
==================

An android app designed to allow use of reddit while offline. Caches the relevant information in reddit posts, as well as the links to web pages.

Currently runs into memory issues if you try to store more than 200 posts with 5 comments per post. Also tends to have memory issues with image heavy subreddits (pics, funny etc).
